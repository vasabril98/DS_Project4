# HR Promotion Data Model


## Overview of the Analysis
  In this project we use a HR dataset retrieved from Kaggle.com to run a model that predicts employee promotions.  The goals are to see what factors play a role or the most significant roles in employee promotion within this dataset, and to create a model that reaches at least 75% accuracy.  The dataset used contains 13 columns and has features like "awards_won?", "age", "education", and "region" to name a few.  We used Random Forest Classifer for our model and used SMOTE to normalize our data because the the dataset column for "is_promoted" was unbalanced.  We also used a Logistic regression model to optimize the model for more accuracy.
